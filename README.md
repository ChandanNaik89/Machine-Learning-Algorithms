## What is Machine Learning ##     
 
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
     
### How does Machine Learning work ##
  
A Machine Learning system learns from historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever it receives new data, predicts the output for it. The accuracy of predicted output depends upon the amount of data, as the huge amount of data helps to build a better model which predicts the output more accurately.

Suppose we have a complex problem, where we need to perform some predictions, so instead of writing a code for it, we just need to feed the data to generic algorithms, and with the help of these algorithms, machine builds the logic as per the data and predict the output. Machine learning has changed our way of thinking about the problem.

## Features of Machine Learning: ##   

Machine learning uses data to detect various patterns in a given dataset.
It can learn from past data and improve automatically. 
It is a data-driven technology.
Machine learning is much similar to data mining as it also deals with the huge amount of the data.

## Classification of Machine Learning ##
At a broad level, machine learning can be classified into three types:

Supervised learning 
Unsupervised learning
Reinforcement learning

## Supervised Machine Learning ## 

Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, 
and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.
The goal of supervised learning is to map input data with the output data. The supervised learning is based on supervision, and it is the same as when a student learns things in the supervision of the teacher.


## Classification of Supervised learning:

Classification, Regression 

##  Unsupervised Learning ##

Unsupervised learning is a learning method in which a machine learns without any supervision.The training is provided to the machine with the set of data that has not been labeled, classified, or categorized, and the algorithm needs to act on that data without any supervision. The goal of unsupervised learning is to restructure the input data into new features or a group of objects with similar patterns.In unsupervised learning, we don't have a predetermined result. The machine tries to find useful insights from the huge amount of data. It can be further classifieds into two categories of algorithms:

## Classification of Unsupervised Learning

1.) Clustering
2.) Association. 

## Reinforcement Learning ## 

Reinforcement learning is a feedback-based learning method, in which a learning agent gets a reward for each right action and gets a penalty for each wrong action. The agent learns automatically with these feedbacks and improves its performance. In reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with the environment and explores it. The goal of an agent is to get the most reward points, and hence, it improves its performance. The robotic dog, which automatically learns the movement of his arms, is an example of Reinforcementlearning.

## History of Machine Learning ##

Before some years (about 40-50 years), machine learning was science fiction, but today it is the part of our daily life. Machine learning is making our day to day life easy from self-driving cars to Amazon virtual assistant "Alexa". However, the idea behind machine learning is so old and has a long history. Below some milestones are given which have occurred in the history of machine learning

## Need for Machine Learning ##

The need for machine learning is increasing day by day. The reason behind the need for machine learning is that it is capable of doing tasks that are too complex for a person to implement directly. As a human, we have some limitations as we cannot access the huge amount of data manually, so for this, we need some computer systems and here comes the machine learning to make things easy for us. We can train machine learning algorithms by providing them the huge amount of data and let them explore the data, construct the models, and predict the required output automatically. The performance of the machine learning algorithm depends on the amount of data, and it can be determined by the cost function. With the help of machine learning, we can save both time and money.
